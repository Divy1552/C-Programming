Q1: Write a C program that takes two matrices (A and B) as input and performs matrix addition to produce
    the resulting matrix C. The program should implement the addition logic and print the resulting matrix.

    Enter rows and columns for matrix A: 2 2
    Enter elements of matrix A:
    1 2
    3 4

    Enter rows and columns for matrix B: 2 2
    Enter elements of matrix B:
    5 6
    7 8

    Output: The sum of matrix A and B is:
            6 8
            10 12

Q2: Write a C program that reverses the elements of an array using a function.

    Instructions:
        • Create a function reverseArray() that takes an array and its size as parameters and reverses the elements in place.
        • Create another function printArray() that takes an array and its size as parameters and print the elements of the array.
        • In the main() function, call reverseArray() and printArray() to display the reversed array.

    Enter the size of the array: 5
    Enter elements of the array: 1 2 3 4 5
    Reversed array: 5 4 3 2 1

Q3: Write a C program to check whether a given array is a palindrome (i.e.,it reads the same forward
    and backward).

    Example:
    Enter the size of the array: 5
    Enter elements of the array: 1 2 3 2 1
    The array is a palindrome.

    Enter the size of the array: 4
    Enter elements of the array: 1 2 3 4
    The array is not a palindrome.

    Now use pointer arithmetic to iterate over an integer array and print its values.

Q4: Write a program to convert an integer to a string without using itoa() or similar functions.

    Input: An integer number.
    Output: The string equivalent of the integer.

    Input: -12345
    Output: "-12345"

Q5: Write a program to calculate and print the sum of each row and each column of a 2D array.

    Enter rows and columns of the matrix: 3 3
    Enter elements of the matrix:
    1 2 3
    4 5 6
    7 8 9

    Row-wise sum: 6 15 24
    Column-wise sum: 12 15 18

Q6: Write a C program to check if a given square matrix is an identity matrix.

    Enter the size of the square matrix: 3
    Enter elements of the matrix:
    1 0 0
    0 1 0
    0 0 1
    
    The matrix is an identity matrix.
