Q1: Write a C program that takes two matrices (A and B) as input and performs matrix multiplication to produce
    the resulting matrix C. The program should implement the multiplication logic and print the resulting matrix.

    Example:
    
    Enter rows and columns for matrix A: 2 3
    Enter rows and columns for matrix B: 3 2
    Enter elements of matrix A:
    1 2 3
    4 5 6
    Enter elements of matrix B:
    7   8
    9  10
    11 12

    Output: The product of matrix A and B is:
            58   64
            139 154

Q2: Write a C program that calculates the sum of elements in an array using a function.

    Instructions:
        • Create a function sumArray() that takes an array and its size as parameters and returns the sum of the
          array elements.
        • In the main() function, call sumArray() and display the result.

    Enter the size of the array: 5
    Enter elements of the array: 1 2 3 4 5
    The sum of the elements in the array is: 15

Q3: Demonstrate using sizeof operator w.r.t different data types to calculate its element size.

    Example: for int array a, a/sizeof(a[0]) should output 4                                     
    Similarly 8 for float type (depends on the system type)

Q4: Write a program to convert a given string to an integer without using atoi() or similar functions.

    Input: A string representing a number.
    Output: The integer equivalent of the string.

Q5: Write a program to find the largest and smallest elements in a 2D array and print their positions (row and
    column).

Q6: Check for Symmetry in a Matrix: Write a program to check if a given square matrix is symmetric i.e. 
    a[i][j]=a[j][i]
