Question 1: Given a string s, the score of the string is defined as the sum of the absolute difference between
            the ASCII values of adjacent characters. Return the score of s.

Example:    Input: s = "hello"
            Output: 13

Question 2: Find Maximum Absolute Difference in an Array.

Statement: Given an integer array, return the maximum absolute difference between any two elements in the array.

Example:    Input: arr = [1, 9, 3, -5, 7]
            Output: 14

Question 3: Implement a function mysteryFunction(int x, int y) Example(hint: Use operators):

            mysteryFunction(5, 3) → 6
            mysteryFunction(10, 4) → 14
            mysteryFunction(7, 2) → 5
            mysteryFunction(8, 1) → 9

Question 4: You are given an integer array. Your task is to find a subarray whose sum is zero. If such a
            subarray exists, return its length; otherwise, return 0.

Example :   Input: arr = [4, 2, -3, 1, 6] 
            Output: 3
