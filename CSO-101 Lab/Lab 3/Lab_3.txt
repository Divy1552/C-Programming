Q1: Write a program that calculates the check digit for an EAN. The user will input the first 12 digits as a
    single number and the program should output the check digit.

    European Article Numbers (EANs) use a 13-digit code, where the last digit is a check digit used to verify the
    code's validity. To calculate the check digit:
      - Add the 2nd, 4th, 6th, 8th, 10th, and 12th digits.
      - Add the 1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th, and 11th digits.
      - Multiply the sum from Step 1 by 3 and add it to the sum from Step 2.
      - Subtract 1 from the total.
      - Compute the remainder of the result when divided by 10.
      - Subtract the remainder from 9 to get the check digit.

    Example:
    For the EAN 8691484260008:
    First sum (2nd, 4th, ...): 
    6+1+8+2+0+0=17
    Second sum (1st, 3rd, ...): 8+9+4+4+6+0=31
    Total: 17×3+31=82
    Subtract 1: 82−1=81
    Remainder when divided by 10: 81%10=1
    Check digit: 9−1=8

Q2: Write a program to solve quadratic equations using the formula
    𝑥 = −𝑏 ± √𝑏2 − 4𝑎𝑐/2𝑎
    Input: Values of a, b, c
    Output: Possible values for x

Q3: Compound Assignment Operators: Take two integers and demonstrate the use of compound assignment operators like
    +=, −=, ∗= 𝑎𝑛𝑑 /= .

Q4: Write a program that calculates the average marks of a student from five subjects. The marks for each subject
    are stored as integers, but the average should be displayed as a floating-point value with two decimal places.

Q5: Swapping Two Numbers Without a Temporary Variable
    a = 5, b = 10
    After swapping: a = 10, b = 5
