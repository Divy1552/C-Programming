Q1: Write a recursive function to compute a^b (i.e., a raised to the power b).

    Example:    
    Input: a = 2, b = 5
    Output: 32

Q2: Write a recursive function to compute the sum of the first N natural numbers.

    Example:
    Input: N = 10
    Output: 55

Q3: Write a recursive function to reverse a given integer.

    Example:
    Input: 1234567
    Output: 7654321

Q4: Write a function to swap the values of two variables using pointers. The function should not print anything,
    and the values should be printed before and after swapping in the main() function.

    Example:
    Input: a = 10, b = 20
    Output: Before swap: a = 10, b = 20
            After swap: a = 20, b = 10
