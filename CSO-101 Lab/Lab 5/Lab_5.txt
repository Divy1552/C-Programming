❖ Write a C program that displays the name of the day of the week based on a number entered by the user. The
program should:
• Prompt the user to enter a number between 1 and 7.
• Use a switch statement to determine which day corresponds to the number.
• Print the name of the day (e.g., 1 = Monday, 2 = Tuesday, etc.).
• If the user enters a number outside the range of 1-7, print an error message.

❖ Write a c program to print the pattern given below:
                            *
                          * *
                        * * *
                      * * * *
                    * * * * *
                        
 
 
❖ Write a C program to check whether a given number is a palindrome or not. A palindrome number is a number that
remains the same when its digits are reversed
Example: 121, 545, 12321

❖ Write a C program to calculate the factorial of a given positive integer.
